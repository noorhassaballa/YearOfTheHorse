                    I have been promoted as a team software engineer leading to a transition into stability. I will be sure and steady in my path with a firm foundation. I have my own car, and I finally got my driver's license. I put away money in savings so I can start investing for my future. I’m able to travel during my time off and I take solo vacations to explore the places I used to dream about someday seeing. I am able to invest in my health and nutrition, and I never have to worry about going hungry to pay the bills again. I’m stronger mentally and physically than I’ve ever been. Because of the strength I have built, inside and out, I am fearless and unshakeable. Nothing can stand in my way.
