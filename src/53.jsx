                    <i>The softest light can illuminate in the darkness.</i> <br/> <br/>
                    I’m focused on being a role model for others and giving guidance wherever I can. I have an entire community of mentees, former bosses, former coworkers, and supporters that I work hard to unite so they can support one another. My nonprofit is thriving, and I continue to support other foundations and programs that improve the condition of all mankind. I travel to different places to speak and offer anything I can to support others in their journeys. When I’m not travelling, I’m living off the land in a carbon neutral home. I spend my time gardening, knitting, and tending to my animals. I write a memoir about all of my experiences so that I can pass on what I’ve learned to generations to come. My writing will be a guiding light to those who have escaped their own darkness, and are in need of a light to guide the way.
