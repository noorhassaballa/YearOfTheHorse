                    After having attained financial stability within tech industry, I have the firm foundation I need to focus on creating a meaningful social impact. Although I’ve been donating to campaigns and supporting social movements throughout my life, I have an opportunity to give back the good karma I’ve received. I start a nonprofit organization that provides healing resources to underfunded school districts, and I built an online forum for queer people of color to connect and share experiences. I spend much of my time giving back to my community. I am no longer fixed in position to the corporate world. I flow between my engineering work and my nonprofit fluidly. I am able to reach thousands of people and help them live healthier lives.
