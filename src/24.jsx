                    Transition from one life into another. Ravens are thought to be messengers between the physical and the spiritual. I grew a deeper sense of spirituality this year as my physical reality tranformed. Everything that stood in the way of my destiny was destroyed, whether I wanted it to or not. There were so many endings in 2024. I lost family, friends, a home, and an entire concept of who I am. I gained purpose, resilience, and a deeper connection to my true self. I learned that my grief is a reflection of the depth of my love, and disappointment a reflection of the depth of my hope. My wish for this year was to be accepted for who I am. By accepting myself, I gained the approval I was looking for. And I found acceptance in the community of i.c.stars.
