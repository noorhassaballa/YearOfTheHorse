                   I am learning to be intentional in my prayers, and to trust that things are meant to happen the way that they happen. I'm starting my journey as a software engineer, and my faith is stronger than ever. I am going to learn the technical skills I need to thrive as a software engineer, and praying for a work environment that nurtures my growth by providing opportunities for my career development. I am earning security for myself and for my future. After everything that happened in 2024, I truly have nothing to lose. Based on last year, I know that I will always be provided with what I need. My wish for this year is to have a new beginning. I'm taking a leap of faith and setting out on a new path.
