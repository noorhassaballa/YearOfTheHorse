                    <i>The past is only a memory.</i> <br/> <br/>
                    Like a snake shedding its skin, the past is behind me, and I am embarking on a new journey. It’s been over 7 years since I started my journey, the amount of time it takes for every cell in my body to be replaced by a new cell. I am literally a new version of me. I am now a senior engineer, and I do my own freelance consulting work. I am no longer bound to a single source of income. I start my own business as a consultant, and I’m finally working for myself as an entrepreNoor. I have freedom to move in any direction, and I am flexible. I solve problems with speed and accuracy due to my experience. I am building my ideal “nest” with the money I’ve saved and I’m cementing my position in the tech industry.
