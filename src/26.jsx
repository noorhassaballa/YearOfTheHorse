                    <i>Wisdom sees in the dark.</i> <br/> <br/>
                    Everything that was once hidden in the darkness to me is now fully illuminated and crystal clear. I am learning tons of new things in my career and feeling more capable with all the knowledge I have gained. My ability to learn quickly makes me a strong contender within my company. As I provide finances and physical safety for myself, I have more capacity for healing from the past. I understand myself on a deeper level and unlearn patterns of self-neglect. Able to take care of myself in new ways, I am developing new routines that balance work and life. I earn a deep sense of wisdom that will carry on throughout the rest of my life.
