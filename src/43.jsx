                    Due to the success of my nonprofit, I’ve been able to have a positive influence on the lives of thousands of students. I’m a changemaker in my community, and I decide to run for public office in a local election. My campaign is centered on abolishing income inequality and social democracy, emphasizing the importance of a society that values people holistically rather than as vehicles for profit. I draw on my C56 cohorts and their accomplishments as evidence of the amount of potential that is sacrificed by our current economic structure. I advocate for how investment in individual well-being leads to better outcomes as a society. Whether I win or lose, my nonprofit can gain visibility and funders who will continue to create change for young people across the country.
