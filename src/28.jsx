                    As my career progresses, I will become more established in my brand.  I don’t have to “roar” to be heard—my work speaks for itself. I am a leader, balanced in technical knowledge and social awareness. My experiences guide me to move carefully with power. I have found my “pride.” I am accompanied by those who understand me and back me up. I accomplish great things with the network I have developed, and I’m supported by many people who want to see me become the best version of myself. I feel confident where I'm at and I devote my spare time to open source projects and personal creations to advance my learning.
